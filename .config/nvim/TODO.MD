# Snippets
- Add sensible binds for snippets
	- maybe separating between file creation "snippets" and snippets, that are added inside of files ? 
	- does it make sense to separate between file templates and snippets ?

# Debugging
- Add more keybinds for debugging in nvim dap/dap ui
- make it so, that keybinds change on dap attach and unattach
	- do i need all my editing keybinds during debugging ? 

# LSP
- make lsp file type specific (does that mean they only load on opening this file type ?)
- find out a way to make it show in the status bar what lsp is loaded and in case there 
  is schema selection what schema is being applied (i.e. yaml files could be kubernetes or gitlab ci pipes)
